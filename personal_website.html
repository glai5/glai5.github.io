    Hello! My name is Gavin Hongchi Lai. 
    I grew up in Irvine, California in a family of four with an older brother. 
    I’m a meticulous and honest person who finishes what I start with my best effort. 
    I’m interested in exploring how math intersects with other subjects and am open to suggestions!
